Can any secrets still be shed by the venerable Elliptic Billiard? Indeed, interactive experimentation with the family of 3-periodic trajectories have uncovered striking properties. We started with the geometry of Triangular centers loci, and this produced many beautiful curves, including ellipses, quartics, circles, and even a stationary point! Surprisingly, we found this family conserves the ratio of Inradius to Circumradius which in turn implies conservation of the sum of cosines. Close observation of a closely-related object -- Monge's Orthoptic Circle -- provided key clues to generalize newfound 3-periodic properties to closed trajectories of any number of edges.
